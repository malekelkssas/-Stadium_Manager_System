# -Stadium_Manager_System
About This project is part of the Databases Course. The project is a stadium management system which is designed to keep track of all tickets, fans, clubs, and matches

## CSEN 501 ( Databases) Project :
 The Project aims to manage everything related to the football cycle starting from a fan who wants to attend matches by purchasing some tickets then moving to the club representative who can ask for host request for his / her club, host requests are handled by the stadium manager who can accept or reject the request coming from a certain club representative. Furthermore, the system also contains a Sport Association Manager who can add new matches to the schedule and of course the System Admin who can block fans, add or delete stadiums and clubs.
